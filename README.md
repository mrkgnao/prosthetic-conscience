# Prosthetic Conscience

This repo hosts an in-progress experiment that seeks to construct a useful *exocortex*, a system that augments the mind with non-human capabilities of memory formation and information retrieval, using Haskell, PostgreSQL, and more than a little inspiration from `org-mode`.

## Credits

I learned of the *exocortex* neologism from Shrutarshi Basu ([@basus](https://twitter.com/basus)).
